# Youtube Clone
This project is a clone of YouTube, built using vanilla HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the core layout and design of YouTube's interface, focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly design for practice and brush up my skills in web development.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure and content of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page, including layout, color scheme, and responsiveness.
- **Media Queries**: Used to make the layout responsive and mobile-friendly.
